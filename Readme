//Hello guys
//This is a github file that is meant specifically to store code
//You will be storing all the code for your projects here, so that you will be able to access the code from home in
//case you don't have a computer at home that has Unity on it. 
//You will all have to create a github account, and create a "repository". This is sort of like an online folder for your code
//Inside your repository you have to create a readme file. Inside, just write your first name and the name of the class
